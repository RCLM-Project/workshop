# TEI Publisher From Scratch

This repository contains data and assignments for our online workshop «Stay Home Learn TEI Publisher From Scratch». It is a 3-part online course taking place on the 8th, 15th and 22nd of June, always at 4-5 pm (CEST).

The online session will be more lecture-like with room for questions. Afterwards attendants are encouraged to work through a  list of weekly assignments. Usually the first assignment for each topic will be covered in the online session, but we would recommend that participants redo it on their own.

## Prerequisites

The online session will be hosted on jitsi. Please use the following URL to connect:

https://meet.jit.si/e-editiones-events

Should anything go wrong during the event, we will inform you via [twitter](https://twitter.com/eeditiones) and the slack channel mentioned below.

Participants are strongly encouraged to join the  dedicated **#workshop** room on the [e-editiones slack](https://join.slack.com/t/e-editiones/shared_invite/zt-e19jc03q-OFaVni~_lh6emSHen6pswg) for asking questions, but also to help others with the assignments. We hope to have a lively discussion there and would love to see participants support each other.

A server will be provided for everyone to work on the exercises. Due to the large number of attendants this might become a bottleneck. We thus encourage the more experienced users to either:

* install TEI Publisher on your local machine. The steps are described in the [TEI Publisher documentation](https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/doc/documentation.xml?id=installation). For the first week it doesn't matter if you install TEI Publisher 5 or the (maybe already released) TEI Publisher 6. The core features are the same in both versions
* use our docker image as described in the [docs](https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/doc/documentation.xml?id=docker)

You may also want to clone this repository or download its contents as a zip. This way you can look at the example documents on your own machine. To clone or download, click the green *Clone or Download* button on the top right of the [start screen](https://github.com/eeditiones/workshop) of this repository.
