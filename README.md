# TEI Publisher From Scratch

This repository contains data and assignments for our online workshop «Stay Home Learn TEI Publisher From Scratch». It is a 3-part online course taking place on the 8th, 15th and 22nd of June, always at 4-5 pm (CEST).

The online session will be more lecture-like with room for questions. Afterwards attendants are encouraged to work through a  list of weekly assignments. Usually the first assignment for each topic will be covered in the online session, but we would recommend that participants redo it on their own.

Participants are strongly encouraged to join the  dedicated room (to be announced) on the [e-editiones slack](https://join.slack.com/t/e-editiones/shared_invite/zt-e19jc03q-OFaVni~_lh6emSHen6pswg) for asking questions, but also to help others with the assignments. We hope to have a lively discussion there and would love to see participants support each other.
